# Question 9: Find the pythagorean triplet, https://projecteuler.net/problem=9

# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
# a2 + b2 = c2
# a + b + c = 1000
# For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# # Find the product abc.

# What we know:
# 1. The sum of the values is 1000
# 2. a is less than b which is less than c
# 3. c can be calculated from a + b
# 4. Then we can test using the pythagorean triplet formula a2 + b2 = c2

# Approach:
# Need to iterate for each possible a over a range of b, calculatre c, then test.

#Track time
import time
start_time = time.time()

# Solution:
for a in range(1, 500):
    for b in range (1,500):
        c = 1000 - (a + b) # since we know a + b + c = 1000
        if a < b < c: # condition 1 satisfy that a is less than b is less than c
            if a ** 2 + b ** 2 == c ** 2: # condition 2, test for Pythagorean tripletyness
                print("The product of the Pythagorean Triplets of 1000 is:", (a * b * c))
